        <h2>GHANA'S AKAN NAMING CALCULATOR.</h2>
        <p>
          The Akan are the largest ethnic group in both Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
          The Akan speak Kwa languages which are part of the larger Niger-Congo
          family. From the 15th century to the 19th century, the Akan people
          dominated gold mining and the gold trade in the region.

          <p>
            The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day
            of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
            These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
            character of the person.This web application takes a user's birthday
            and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending
            on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
